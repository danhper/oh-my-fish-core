# Core Library

## Basic Functions

#### `autoload` _`[-e] <path>...`_

Manipulate [autoloading](http://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html#syntax-function-autoloading) path components.

All paths ending with `completions` are correctly added to or erased from
`$fish_complete_path`.

To add paths to autoload:

```fish
autoload $mypath $mypath/completions
```

To erase paths from autoload:

```fish
autoload -e $mypath $mypath/completions
```

#### `available` _`<name>`_

Check if a program is available to run. Sets `$status` to `0` if the program is available.

Use this function to check if a plugin is available before using it:

```fish
if available battery
  battery
end
```

#### `refresh`

Replace the running instance of fishshell with a new one causing Oh My Fish to reload as well.

#### `prompt_segments`

Extract the root (top-most parent directory), dirname and basename from [`fish_prompt`](http://fishshell.com/docs/current/faq.html#faq-prompt).

##### Default values:

+ ahead: `+`
